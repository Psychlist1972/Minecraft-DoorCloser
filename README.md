# Minecraft-DoorCloser
Minecraft (Spigot server) plugin to automatically close doors / gates / trap-doors that were opened by a player. 

You can configure which ones are in scope to be auto-closed, as well as if it should close when the player is in creative mode or is sneaking. I recommend leaving both of those as false to support using things like trap doors as decoration blocks (sides of chairs, etc.)

Requires
* Java 1.8
* Minecraft Spigot 1.12 (for 1.0.3 plugin)
* Minecraft Spigot 1.13.2 (for subsequent plugin versions)

Latest .jar file can be found in the /target folder

Latest standard configuration File can be found in /src/main/resources/config.yml. It's also auto-generated when you load the plugin for the first time.

1.13.2 version supports all new 1.13 types.
