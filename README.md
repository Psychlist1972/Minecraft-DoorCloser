Minecraft (Spigot server) plugin to automatically close doors / gates / trap-doors that were opened by a player.

You can configure which ones are in scope to be auto-closed, as well as if it should close when the player is in creative mode or is sneaking. I recommend leaving both of those as false to support using things like trap doors as decoration blocks (sides of chairs, etc.)

Requires
* Java 1.8 or newer
* Minecraft Spigot 1.13 or newer

Latest .jar file can be found in the /target folder

Latest standard configuration File can be found in /src/main/resources/config.yml. It's also auto-generated when you load the plugin for the first time.
