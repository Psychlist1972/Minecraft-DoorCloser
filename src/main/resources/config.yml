# Config file for DoorCloser
# If you make any changes to this file, you must restart

# GeneratedByVersion
# Generated from plugin version ${project.version}. I do
# not recommend making any manual change to this value. It's
# here for future compatibility.
GeneratedByVersion: ${project.version}

# IgnoreCanceledEvents
# This is an internal thing, mostly for debugging interaction
# with other plugins. The plugin should always ignore
# canceled events unless you've found a very specific
# reason not to
IgnoreCanceledEvents: true

# Time: Time (in integer seconds) to allow the door to remain open
# This is an estimate. How long it really stays open depends
# on how quickly Spigot can get to the event handler. It won't
# be faster than this, but will typically be slower, again,
# depending upon server load, number of plugins running, etc.
Time: 5

# double-door handling. This is a bit outside the original scope
# of this plugin, but was a community request. It's optional here
# because you may already have plugins handling this, and so the
# behavior might be weird.
#
# SynchronizeDoubleDoorOpen: automatically open the second door
# when you click on one of the doors in a pair. Detection algorithm
# checks for where the hinges are located.
# SynchronizeDoubleDoorClose: same thing, but synchronizes closing
SynchronizeDoubleDoorOpen: true
SynchronizeDoubleDoorClose: true

# PlaySound: True if the door/gate/trapdoor closing sound should be played
PlaySound: true

# IgnoreIfInCreative: true if you want to ignore the door when the player
# is in creative mode if this is not set to true, you'll never be able to
# create an open door unless you turn on sneaking.
IgnoreIfInCreative: true

# IgnoreIfSneaking: true if you want to ignore the door when the player is
# sneaking. This will work for all players, not just someone in creative
IgnoreIfSneaking: false
